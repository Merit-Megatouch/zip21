# ZIP21 (zip21)

One game of [megatouch-port](https://github.com/Merit-Megatouch/megatouch-port):
original Megatouch ION cabinet games running on Linux / WSL2.

This repo holds the port's configuration and notes — no cabinet code or assets. Use it from
the main repo, where it lives at `games/zip21`:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Merit-Megatouch/megatouch-port
cd megatouch-port && make setup && make new GAME=zip21 && make run GAME=zip21
```

| File | What |

| [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) | Status, checklist, dated log |
| [notes/scaffold.md](notes/scaffold.md) | Facts found when scaffolding |
